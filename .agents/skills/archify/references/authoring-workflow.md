## Fast authoring path

Use this bounded path for ordinary generation. Do not read the optional Viewer Runtime reference unless the user asks about those features.

1. Choose `architecture`, `workflow`, `sequence`, `dataflow`, or `lifecycle` from the question.
2. Read one matching schema in `schemas/`, `schemas/common.schema.json`, and one matching JSON example in `examples/`. Read only those files. Fresh authorship means new stable IDs, domain wording, and layout; use the example for field shape, not facts. New workflow sources use `schema_version: 2` and its readable layout contract; keep `schema_version: 1` only when preserving an existing workflow's fixed geometry. When real product identity matters, query `node bin/archify.mjs brands "<name>" --json`; read `references/brand-marks.md` only for an unknown brand with a user-provided URL.
3. After required source and schema checks, write an early candidate; do not block necessary fact or permission checks merely to make the next tool action a write. Write the candidate before inspecting renderer internals. Do not plan exact coordinates in prose. Start with one clear main path, short side branches, sparse labels, and at most 12 primary nodes. Set `meta.quality_profile` to `"showcase"` unless the user explicitly requests a dense `standard` map. Start with automatic routes and labels. Do not add `via`, `channelX`, `channelY`, or `labelAt` before a diagnostic calls for one; apply at most one diagnosed geometry control per repair.
4. Validate after every candidate edit and immediately before handoff:

   ```bash
   node bin/archify.mjs validate <type> <candidate.json> --quality showcase --json
   ```

   A receipt with only 4 artifact checks is basic validation, never showcase acceptance. A showcase pass must report all 9 artifact checks with 0 composition errors and 0 warnings. If the candidate omits or misspells the exact `meta.quality_profile` field, fix it before geometry. For a workflow v2 geometry diagnosis, run `node bin/archify.mjs validate workflow <candidate.json> --layout-json` and use the stable compiler receipt; solver internals are not authoring controls. A passing final validation freezes the candidate: never edit it afterward.
5. For a delivered HTML, `deliver` is the final acceptance command:

   ```bash
   node bin/archify.mjs deliver <type> <candidate.json> <output.html> --quality showcase --json
   ```

   A non-zero exit can never be described as success. A failed delivery preserves any previous output, so do not run `visual-check` on that path: it would inspect the stale last-good artifact, not the failed candidate. If validation fails, change only the diagnosed `subject`, verify `evidence`, choose from `supportedFixes`, and rerun. Continue focused correction while the objective error count reaches a new minimum. If two consecutive rounds do not improve that best count, stop and report the unresolved diagnostics truthfully.
