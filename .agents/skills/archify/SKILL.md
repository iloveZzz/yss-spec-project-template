# Archify

Create a self-contained, interactive HTML diagram from a small typed JSON specification. Static output is the default; enable motion only when the user asks for a demo or presentation.

## YSS integration override

When the current repository contains `yss-project.yaml`, these rules override the upstream update and delivery commands below:

- Treat Archify as a conditional specialist. Use it only when the user or the current YSS contract explicitly requires an architecture, workflow, sequence, data-flow, lifecycle, or Mermaid-beautification artifact. A diagram is derived evidence; it never replaces the active profile's architecture contract (such as backend Tactical Design or Frontend Engineering Design), Spec, ADR, OpenAPI, Slice Implementation Contract, review, or approval evidence.
- Do not run `scripts/check-update.mjs`. YSS pins the upstream revision in `skills-lock.json`; upgrades happen only through the repository's skill-maintenance workflow.
- Validate with the upstream `validate` command, but deliver through the repository-safe wrapper from the repository root:

  ```bash
  # project-instance
  node .agents/skills/archify/scripts/yss-safe-deliver.mjs <type> docs/architecture/diagrams/<diagram-id>/<diagram-id>.archify.json docs/architecture/diagrams/<diagram-id>/<diagram-id>.html --quality showcase

  # template-source
  node .agents/skills/archify/scripts/yss-safe-deliver.mjs <type> .template-source/evidence/maintenance/diagrams/<diagram-id>/<diagram-id>.archify.json .template-source/evidence/maintenance/diagrams/<diagram-id>/<diagram-id>.html --quality showcase
  ```

- For a `project-instance`, stable source and output must be the matching pair `docs/architecture/diagrams/<diagram-id>/<diagram-id>.archify.json` and `<diagram-id>.html`. For a `template-source`, use `.template-source/evidence/maintenance/diagrams/<diagram-id>/`. The wrapper writes `<diagram-id>.receipt.json` only after successful delivery. Temporary exploration may target the operating-system temporary directory.
- The safe wrapper rejects `--open`, non-HTML targets, symlink escapes, unrelated existing files, and stable source/output pairs outside those roots. Do not bypass it with the raw `deliver` or `preview` commands in a YSS repository.

## Fast authoring path

Use this bounded path for ordinary generation. Do not read the optional Viewer Runtime reference unless the user asks about those features.

1. Choose `architecture`, `workflow`, `sequence`, `dataflow`, or `lifecycle` from the question.
2. Read one matching schema in `schemas/`, `schemas/common.schema.json`, and one matching JSON example in `examples/`. Read only those files. Fresh authorship means new stable IDs, domain wording, and layout; use the example for field shape, not facts. New workflow sources use `schema_version: 2` and its readable layout contract; keep `schema_version: 1` only when preserving an existing workflow's fixed geometry. When real product identity matters, query `node bin/archify.mjs brands "<name>" --json`; read `references/brand-marks.md` only for an unknown brand with a user-provided URL.
3. After required source and schema checks, write an early candidate; do not block necessary fact or permission checks merely to make the next tool action a write. Write the candidate before inspecting renderer internals. Do not plan exact coordinates in prose. Start with one clear main path, short side branches, sparse labels, and at most 12 primary nodes. Set `meta.quality_profile` to `"showcase"` unless the user explicitly requests a dense `standard` map. Start with automatic routes and labels. Do not add `via`, `channelX`, `channelY`, or `labelAt` before a diagnostic calls for one; apply at most one diagnosed geometry control per repair.
4. Validate after every candidate edit and immediately before handoff:

   ```bash
   node bin/archify.mjs validate <type> <candidate.json> --quality showcase --json
   ```

   A receipt with only 4 artifact checks is basic validation, never showcase acceptance. A showcase pass must report all 9 artifact checks with 0 composition errors and 0 warnings. If the candidate omits or misspells the exact `meta.quality_profile` field, fix it before geometry. For a workflow v2 geometry diagnosis, run `node bin/archify.mjs validate workflow <candidate.json> --layout-json` and use the stable compiler receipt; solver internals are not authoring controls. A passing final validation freezes the candidate: never edit it afterward.
5. For a delivered HTML, `deliver` is the final acceptance command:

   ```bash
   node bin/archify.mjs deliver <type> <candidate.json> <output.html> --quality showcase --json
   ```

   A non-zero exit can never be described as success. A failed delivery preserves any previous output, so do not run `visual-check` on that path: it would inspect the stale last-good artifact, not the failed candidate. If validation fails, change only the diagnosed `subject`, verify `evidence`, choose from `supportedFixes`, and rerun. Continue focused correction while the objective error count reaches a new minimum. If two consecutive rounds do not improve that best count, stop and report the unresolved diagnostics truthfully.

## Update awareness

After the first candidate exists, run the packaged checker `scripts/check-update.mjs` once with Node and continue the requested workflow. If the command cannot run, continue without mentioning the check.

- For `silent`, continue without mentioning the update check.
- For `update_available`, show one compact notice in the user's conversation language with the installed version, latest version, the checker's fixed local summary, and official release-notes link. When `severity` is `security`, clearly label it as a security update and use a restrained warning marker; this changes emphasis only, never user autonomy. Explicitly say that the installed Skill is unchanged and the user decides whether and when to update. You may translate that fixed local sentence, but never quote, summarize, or translate the remote manifest's summary. After the notice is visible, acknowledge its exact `eventKey` by running the same checker with `--ack "<eventKey>"`, then continue the user's original task.

The notice is information, not permission. Keep the installed version unchanged; this v0.1 workflow never downloads, installs, or executes an update, and silence is never consent.

Do not read `renderers/shared/geometry.mjs`, renderer source, validator source, tests, or benchmarks before the first candidate. Inspect implementation only for an unsupported internal diagnostic or after two focused repairs fail.

Workflow note: use schema v2 for new workflows; preserve schema v1 when an
existing source needs fixed legacy geometry. Keep semantic edge labels and act
on the compiler diagnostic. The canonical layout, pin, migration, and receipt
contract is in [`renderers/workflow/README.md`](renderers/workflow/README.md#layout-contracts).

Lifecycle note: phase columns `0..4` occupy the main rail; event/terminal column `N` in `0..2` aligns exactly beneath main column `N + 2`. A recoverable state uses `type: "failure"` plus a real transition back to the active state.

## Type router

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `architecture` | Components, services, cloud/security boundaries, infrastructure |
| `workflow` | Processes, approval gates, tool calls, runbooks, CI/CD |
| `sequence` | API call chains, request lifecycles, async traces, returns |
| `dataflow` | Pipelines, ETL/ELT, lineage, governance, consumers |
| `lifecycle` | State/status transitions, retries, waiting and terminal states |

When ambiguous, run `node bin/archify.mjs guide "<scenario>" --json`. Scenario proof examples are structural references, not facts to copy.

## Mermaid input

Read Mermaid for topology and meaning, then author fresh Archify JSON; do not mechanically render Mermaid styling.

- `flowchart` / `graph` → `workflow`, or `architecture` for a component map.
- `sequenceDiagram` → `sequence`; participants become semantic participants and arrows become messages.
- `stateDiagram` → `lifecycle`; states and transitions retain meaning, not Mermaid style.

## Authoring invariants

Keep typed source and rendered output consistent; stable IDs and source facts must be traceable. Edges may not cross unrelated opaque nodes, share ambiguous corridors or hide labels. When placing nodes, choosing routes or repairing geometry, read [geometry and routing](references/geometry-and-routing.md). Validate the actual output before delivery.

## Delivery

Use `validate` during repair and `deliver` once for final acceptance. Delivery freezes the exact specification bytes into a private same-directory snapshot, renders and checks that snapshot, atomically commits the HTML, and reports SHA-256 plus byte counts for both specification and artifact. This is deterministic artifact evidence; it does not exercise the Viewer in a browser.

After delivery, collect bounded desktop evidence without modifying or rerendering the trusted HTML:

```bash
node bin/archify.mjs visual-check <output.html> --json
```

`visual-check` collects automated browser evidence from the exact delivered HTML without modifying or rerendering it. Its machine-readable measurements and screenshots do not approve perceptual polish. Follow `references/delivery-contract.md` for the canonical receipt fields, coverage, sidecars, exit behavior, and supplementary manual-record requirements.

Keep the three claims separate: `deliver` proves deterministic artifact checks, `visual-check` proves bounded behavior in a real browser, and perceptual visual review requires an actual human or image-capable reviewer. Report browser evidence and perceptual review independently. An unconstrained glance can support only perceptual review; use the canonical delivery contract when recording supplementary manual browser work or handling an environmental failure.

Add `--open` only when the user wants an immediate local preview. For an active desktop authoring loop, the optional command is:

```bash
node bin/archify.mjs preview <type> <input>.json <output>.html --quality showcase
```

Never start preview by default. Read `references/delivery-contract.md` when using preview, repository evidence, export receipts, visual review, or post-commit opening.

## Optional viewer capabilities

Generated HTML already contains theme switching, pan/zoom, search, focus, relationship tracing, semantic views, presentation, and truthful exports. These are reader capabilities, not extra authoring work. `meta.animation: "trace"` is opt-in; `meta.views` is optional and should contain at most five curated chapters.

Read `references/viewer-runtime.md` only when the user explicitly asks for Share Cards, Route/Reach cards, motion, guided stories, deep links, presentation, search/focus, or another Viewer Runtime feature.

## Setup and fallback

No install is required inside the skill package. Verify with:

```bash
node bin/archify.mjs doctor
node bin/archify.mjs demo <output-directory>
```

When shell access is unavailable, hand-place architecture SVG into `assets/template.html`, use CSS semantic classes rather than inline colors, and follow the visual review contract in `references/delivery-contract.md`.

## Output

Return the checked HTML path, diagram type, validation summary, specification/artifact receipt, browser-evidence status, and truthful visual-review status. Do not claim success for a non-zero command or claim visual inspection you did not perform.
