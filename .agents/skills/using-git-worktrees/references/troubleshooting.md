# 工作树常见错误

仅在入口所列条件命中时读取本文件。Markdown 链接相对本文件；行内 references/assets/schemas 路径相对 Skill 根目录。Git、依赖安装和测试命令从当前仓库或选定的工作树根目录执行。

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Already in linked worktree | Skip creation (Step 0) |
| In a submodule | Treat as normal repo (Step 0 guard) |
| Native worktree tool available | Use it (Step 1a) |
| No native tool | Git worktree fallback (Step 1b) |
| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |
| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |
| Neither exists | Check instruction file, then default `.worktrees/` |
| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore; commit only when authorized |
| Permission error on create | Report failure; preserve the requested isolation boundary |
| Tests fail during baseline | Record failures; continue authorized diagnosis |
| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |

## Common Mistakes

### Fighting the harness

- **Problem:** Using `git worktree add` when the platform already provides isolation
- **Fix:** Step 0 detects existing isolation. Step 1a defers to native tools.

### Skipping detection

- **Problem:** Creating a nested worktree inside an existing one
- **Fix:** Always run Step 0 before creating anything

### Skipping ignore verification

- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status
- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree

### Assuming directory location

- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions
- **Fix:** Follow priority: explicit instructions > existing project-local directory > default

### Proceeding with failing tests

- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues
- **Fix:** Distinguish baseline failures from new defects; ask only for a missing decision
