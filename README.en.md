# YSS Skills and Project Templates

A collection of skills and reference assets for requirements, product design and Java backend development. Start with AGENTS.md and select the skills relevant to the task.

This repository does not maintain script directories, test suites or automatic hooks. GitLab CI builds the Rust CLI on Linux with the current template and checks project installation, synchronization and scaffold generation; it does not package or publish Linux releases. Runners tagged `yss-linux` must use the same architecture to share the built executable. Agents create projects, synchronize skill copies, prepare exports and handle authorized releases directly. Existing CLIs may be used for capabilities they actually support. Builds, tests and reviews are task-specific choices, not universal prerequisites.

Shared content lives in .agents/skills. Backend-specific content lives in profiles/backend. Claude uses linked skills and WorkBuddy uses ordinary file copies. Keep affected copies and distribution lists aligned when changing canonical content; see .template-source/agents/skills-maintenance.md.

Preserve business validation, security, error handling and user files. Commits, pushes, deployments and releases require authorization for those actions. Report observed results and unperformed work honestly.

Installed yss CLI binaries are separate products. Check compatibility against the installed version and its embedded template.
